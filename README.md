If you are only looking for `AsyncView` without the example, please check this Gist: https://gist.github.com/AbdulelahHajjar/c30156053db0fca74bf84ab72f543150

# Introduction
This repository contains the full code and example of the `AsyncView` implementation.

`AsyncView` is a reusable SwiftUI component that simplifies Views that depend on API/Asyncronous data loading, by providing skeleton shimmers, handling error states, and encapsulating cancellation and retry mechanisms.

This component was discussed in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@aab.hajjar/introduction-97ffa32f2689)

# Trying it Out
To try it out, clone the repository, and run it on any simulator.
